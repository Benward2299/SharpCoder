Sharp coding. Love programming.

Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently completing work experience at brainpool, https://github.com/brainpool-ai ðŸŒ‡ I create lots of little Javascript games for fun!

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and the basics of encryption!

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on improving my mini Python games. 

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about C# or VIM and I won't be able to help you!

âš¡ Fun fact: making some money whilst having an intrest in gaming always stood out to me and I also love playing CSGO.
